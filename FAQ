# FAQ

## Why we do this
Recently there has been an increasing amount of comments, posted by bots who are trying to gain karma. /u/Eaten_Eyeballs wants to fight this and created this sub dedicated to the battle against ComBots (Comment Robots). They need to be downvoted and reported to Reddit.

## How can I help?
I created a little copy-paste comment. Just copy it and use it as a reply to the bot comment.
